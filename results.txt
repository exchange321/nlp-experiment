  ==>	Expected a bit more from a few team members over the last month, particu
     	larly Andrew. Currently looking at understanding and addressing issues t
     	o ensure good outcomes particularly in relation to the AWS project.

  ==>	N/A

  ==>	Overall I'm happy with how things are going. Have found the A/B testing 
     	project a bit frustrating at times; spent a lot more time on code review
     	 and getting things corrected than I would have liked. Also feeling a li
     	ttle bit like there's still some 'drive' missing on the project side of 
     	things, though it's likely a fallout from PK and then Pete being away an
     	d not being. There also seems to be a gap between when people in my team
     	 think they've finished a project and when I consider it to be complete;
     	 not sure if my expectations need adjusting or theirs, or maybe a bit of
     	 both.

  ==>	The vision of the company is not clear - we would like to be the best to
     	ol on the events market. What are we going to be there? What features we
     	 would like to improve or build to be better then our competitors on thi
     	s market? Where we would like to be in the next 12/24 months

We build
     	 the product to slow - we are afraid of losing current customers because
     	 of the changes in the platform.

Deployment process is very slow. 

     	
If i compere my onboarding process  and JT's new team member Philippe I
     	 can say I did not have it at all. At first i thought it was lack of the
     	 process in the company but now i think it depends on the team. I think 
     	we should have the same process for all new employees.

I didn't feel 
     	comfortable with whole situation with PK.  It was first time in my life 
     	when someone didn't want to report to me even if it is cultural differen
     	ces we shouldn't have such problems as international company. I think th
     	e reason of that was lack of information about changes in the company wh
     	en i joined.  MJ also didn't know the structure of Product Development t
     	eam and also he did't have a proper onboarding process when he came. He 
     	didn't know who is going to be his manager and I did't  know i'm going t
     	o be his manager. Now i think we go in the same direction and we are foc
     	us on delivering values to the company. 

From my perspective PD shoul
     	dn't be a part of IT team. Why? We should be on the opposite site of the
     	 business. IT Team should concentrate on  the quality and deliver new fe
     	atures from backlog and PD should care of the business (conversion, aver
     	age life time of the account etc) by delivering to the IT Team new ideas
     	 / projects based on the vision of the company, numbers and feedback fro
     	m our customers.

  ==>	I'm looking forward to completing the first project that I'm building. T
     	here's a lot of moving components that're finally coming into place.

  ==>	I'm happy within my role and feel supported from my manager.

  ==>	Busy. Was supposed to start lunch 20 minutes ago.

  ==>	I'm focused on moving the channel forward but I do feel that I'm a bit p
     	ut into a silo which is a challenge as I need to collaborate with all ar
     	eas of the business to be able to move the channel forward.

  ==>	Happy in my role and looking forward to learning more.

  ==>	The work environment at vision 6 is as good as it gets, in my experience
     	 of course. The work is steady and paced well enough not to be stressful
     	; maintaining a good varied workload.

  ==>	Had a great exposure on learning things from the framework perspective. 
     	Also learnt how the current contact upload process works

  ==>	In these early stages I find it's still difficult to pin down *exactly* 
     	what my role is as it still feel fairly fluid. But it seems to be contin
     	ually  advancing into more complex territory so I'm happy with that.

  ==>	Better month, putting some of our recent difficulties behind us.

  ==>	Would prefer to spend less time on hr/coaching and more time "getting st
     	uff done", though the latter is an outcome of the former.
Feeling very 
     	drained at the moment, will likely be booking in a few long weekends sho
     	rtly.

  ==>	I'm still happy, but the project speccing process is getting me down. Pl
     	us, it would be nice to work on new features instead of revamping old on
     	es.

  ==>	Contact Import has given me a great exposure to how the process works in
     	 terms of functionality an coding (framework). Alot of code reviews has 
     	improved my way of tackling things, making me a bit more organised and s
     	pend less time.

  ==>	I find it odd though that marketing is working on an agency campaign but
     	 it hasn't been discussed or shared with me even though I look after age
     	ncy...

I'm excited on any agency initiatives and especially support t
     	owards my department so I just want to work together as a team and help 
     	in any shape or form.

  ==>	Happy with the role and the projects I'm taking on.

  ==>	I'm not extremely happy to see some projects get stuck at its final stag
     	e for so long, which is caused by a combination of many reasons. I've tr
     	ied harder to fix them, and will keep trying harder in the coming projec
     	ts. Goal is to see them happen less and less.

  ==>	Doing alright.

  ==>	Culture and 'bullying' issues outlined in the previous check-in are stil
     	l present and have not improved. It's getting in the way of completing a
     	ctual work. 

Relationship with my direct manager is great and feel su
     	pported. Marketing team and new recruit, Megan, are forging ahead with a
     	ctivities.   

Working relationship with Irvin has greatly improved wi
     	th the implementation of Jira project management and I'm happy with how 
     	it's all come together.

  ==>	It's a solid workplace.

  ==>	Team member went on holiday. I ended up doing a lot of coding which I en
     	joyed. 

Ben is looking forward to doing a good project, and playing a
     	 major role in the project. However, in the past few months, he either w
     	orked directly with his team leader only or worked on small projects whi
     	ch weren't too enjoyable. I really wish we could give him a good project
     	 to work on and he gets to discuss with not only his team leader, but al
     	so other developers on a daily basis. This is will make both him and mys
     	elf really happy.

  ==>	Was finding getting designs finalised so that we could work more effecti
     	vely and get started properly on the send process project to be a strugg
     	le. I don't really feel as though the designs we settled on were complet
     	e, but there wasn't the focus from either the stakeholders or designer (
     	PK) to get the remaining things sorted. Working on the send process befo
     	re we had designs was far from ideal, but the lesser or two evils. Waiti
     	ng any longer would have put the project further behind and would also h
     	ave frustrated my team (a.k.a. Scott).

  ==>	Lots happening, feeling busy and challenged with the work happening now.
     	 As we wind down for the Christmas season and November,

  ==>	Same as last month, busy working on a project.

  ==>	The job is good, the team are great and very supportive.

  ==>	Has been an uncomfortable couple of weeks – Just feels like I've receive
     	d a lot of heavy and negative feedback which isn't consistent with my ac
     	tual work performance or how I have been carrying myself with the team. 
     	I am getting feedback from Mat upon issues that really are beyond my con
     	trol.

Being told I had to get on the same page as Mat as currently wh
     	at was happening between us wasn’t working. I still feel as though I’ve 
     	been doing all I can to make him successful as CEO, but one small differ
     	ence of opinion is suddenly a critical issue.

When I asked for an exa
     	mple I was told I had acted in a ‘them and us’ fashion in a recent Refer
     	ral meeting by asking why we appeared to be focusing on Direct Referrals
     	 when in fact it was the Reseller that were asking for this option. I st
     	ill feel my query was reasonable and the conversation could have been a 
     	constructive one.

I and others feel quite helpless when it comes to i
     	mproving our current Direct Conversion Issues which have averaged at 12%
     	 for the last 5 weeks. It seems Mat always wants to underplay these issu
     	es, and now I have the sense I am operating against being on his same pa
     	ge when I do raise them.

Being told that Henry Shouldn’t return to wo
     	rk, whatever the reasoning when you consider the commitment his family h
     	as had with V6 for many years this is shame.

Finally it seemed yester
     	day when I raised the possibility of us arranging some support for Chris
     	 that I was being discouraged instead encouraged toward free options whi
     	ch I have investigated and passed onto Jess. Yes the free options are a 
     	good first option, but also as a successful business we have the ability
     	 to support our team if some reason they aren't getting the help they ne
     	ed.

  ==>	Really happy with everything at the moment. The referral program is slow
     	ly coming to life which is exciting and I've really enjoyed the Eventbri
     	te process and sitting in on the meetings and learning from Mat and Pete
     	. Marketing team are all happy and very productive.

  ==>	working on project and scheduling client reported issues is making me or
     	ganise abit more though slowly.

  ==>	Enjoy my role and working with the team. Finding work sometimes is a cha
     	llenge.

  ==>	Same as last month

  ==>	My happiness has declined as of late. My manager is already aware of my 
     	pain points.

  ==>	I knew there were upcoming changes with how the team works and what aspe
     	cts of marketing each team member would be focusing on. 

I feel like 
     	I'm in a phase of my career at Vision6 where I need to re-evaluate how w
     	e approach video and how video can best support the business both in mar
     	keting, sales and support.

  ==>	It has been a bit of a slower month, we haven't had a project so the wor
     	k has mainly been fixing bugs, etc. But other then that I am happy with 
     	my role and the environment.

NB: I want to re-adjust my scale because
     	 I initially gave 10 and there is no way to improve over that, so I thin
     	k a 7 is an excellent score, I just didn't want to add any confusion ove
     	r the lower mark.

  ==>	I think that everything has been going well, I would prefer it to be a l
     	ittle bit busier as we have been a little bit quiet the last week.

  ==>	Quite a few changes occuring and the company is now finally adopting a s
     	tandardised structure that will promote better alignment and efficiencie
     	s.  Looking forward to driving some much needed change through the busin
     	ess and focussing on activities that will drive longer term growth.

  ==>	Just had Holidays - ready to start a fresh year!

  ==>	Xmas slump

  ==>	I put a 9 because I am happy here and nothing is frustrating me. I would
     	 put 10 if I had more projects to do.

  ==>	This is my third day on the job.  Everyone I have met has been really ac
     	commodating and I have been made to feel very welcome.  I'm excited to b
     	e learning all the skills required to do my job to the best of my abilit
     	y.

  ==>	I continue to have clear expectations of what is required of me. I have 
     	a couple of projects that I'm working through and enjoy doing. The work 
     	environment is good. And I've just come off a 2 week break :)

  ==>	Feeling good after the 3 weeks holidays.

  ==>	Its good to work on projects such as contact import

  ==>	Got projects to do

  ==>	Lots of HR challenges right now.  Other business issues related to loss 
     	in organic traffic.  Generally putting out fires while trying to move th
     	e company forward.

  ==>	I had been successfully accomplishing assigned tasks and looking forward
     	 to learn new things and build upon me knowledge.

  ==>	I find the work interesting and the environment/people is excellent

  ==>	It was a bit difficult to complete tasks with inconsistent directions. A
     	nd first things should be done first.

  ==>	My finger is sore and my to-do list is long.

  ==>	Not much has changed since the last Monthly Check In. Just been busy wor
     	king on a project.

  ==>	Workload fluctuates heavily. Some days I do 3 days worth of work and oth
     	er times there are stretches of 2-3 days with nothing to do. I'm still l
     	earning to not panic in the face of stacks and find things to do during 
     	lulls.

  ==>	There is nothing I'm not happy with. 

However, I feel like we can do 
     	more than we did in the last month. Probably need to sit down with Pete 
     	to talk about the details.

  ==>	My biggest issue is just that there's not a lot of traffic coming in - s
     	pecifically on calls/chat during my day. 

There have been some other 
     	projects discussed but I think figuring out where I can direct most of m
     	y energy in the meantime would be the most helpful.

  ==>	Pretty happy, doing interesting work and getting through the tasks. Work
     	 with great people and enjoy coming to work. 

With the last project, 
     	it felt good to setup the JS controller and views by myself and work thr
     	ough the entire process and have it working well.

  ==>	Tough couple of weeks with some HR issues leading to heavy and unproduct
     	ive conversations. We need to ensure our agenda refocuses upon our Strat
     	egic Objectives- Namely Internationalisation and Customer Success... Bit
     	 concerned that our move toward a Marketing Focused company is actually 
     	a shift away from a Customer Success Agenda... I think we need to presen
     	t this to the team carefully and show how what is being proposed for Mar
     	keting supports our Strategic Agenda. If we don't do this I think the te
     	am might see it as a shift in Strategy away from Customer Success becomi
     	ng a whole of business focus. Clearly the arrival of Bart will assist wi
     	th Customer Success becoming a whole of business focus.

  ==>	Had a deep thinking about all the problems i have met.
Had better under
     	standing about back-end operation and API setup.
Try to keep complete s
     	olution.

  ==>	- happy in general, simple signup form project is nearly done although i
     	t is a bit delayed according to the original plan which needs to be impr
     	oved in the next project

- a little bit painful to work with the mark
     	eting team on the website stuff, as their focus, timing...etc is differe
     	nt to ours, and the responsibilities are also not clear enough between t
     	hem and us

  ==>	Very happy with my role, and the new projects and tasks I've been able t
     	o work on.

  ==>	I was looking forward to the aws migration project but it has been put o
     	n hold for now. Other then that no complaints.

  ==>	A number of distractions causing time and energy to be diverted.  Some i
     	ssues also with Google releasing unnamed versions of its code that has s
     	ignificantly harmed our organic traffic.  The knockon effect is in fewer
     	 sign ups and conversions.  This will no doubt impact our numbers over t
     	he coming 6 months.  Have taken necessary steps to focus on solving the 
     	problems including reaching out to SEO consultants to help with the solu
     	tion.  Back channel negative chatter (aka gossip) about team members and
     	 some people focussing too much on what is happening across the company 
     	causing loss of focus on their activities.  Rolling out new company wide
     	 values will hopefully help with this among other corrective actions.

  ==>	Progress towards starting the next project is slow, so rather frustratin
     	g. probably made worse by the last sprint taking so long to reach QA tha
     	t I've half-forgotten what was in it when looking at QA issues. Otherwis
     	e everything is going well.

  ==>	I am happy keeping busy working on a project. When working on a project,
     	 I can visibly see my progress, which is important for the confidence I 
     	have for the project.

  ==>	Contact Import has given me some exposure to understand the process more
     	 minutely. It has given me a good understanding of the new framework in 
     	more detail. Looking forward for such projects.

  ==>	Excited to have new send process and new design language!

  ==>	Get lots of work to do. Have a lot of things to learn.
Lots of good exa
     	mple(developers) to follow.

  ==>	Starting a new major project, helping design new infrastructure communic
     	ation protocols, great fun.

  ==>	Constant complex HR challenges are personally taking their toll. The lev
     	el of politics in our team is at an all time high, frankly the environme
     	nt we are working is draining not energising. We are all too often looki
     	ng inwardly rather than focusing upon those things that make us successf
     	ul or by which doing better will deliver growth.  As a result opportunit
     	ies for growth are being missed, as leaders we need to do better.

  ==>	I do what i love. I build the product with engaged people. We implement 
     	changes in our product to satisfied our customers. We depends on the num
     	bers we follow  our customers needs.

  ==>	The volume of HR issues is the highest it's been for a long time.  The t
     	wo primary antagonists here are the current legal issue with a former em
     	ployee, and the other relates to 1 or 2 existing team members that are f
     	ocussed too much on what else is occurring around them and not enough on
     	 just getting on with their OKRs, tasks etc.  A sense of entitlement als
     	o seems to exist with these employees.  Subsequently, there is a higher 
     	level of negative gossip and lack of maturity being shown by at least on
     	e person.  Whilst this should not really pose problems, the pervasivenes
     	s of the gossip and positioning of their own self can be quite cancerous
     	 to a small organisation like V6 and can bring others down with them.  H
     	opefully, once the legal matter is resolved, we can focus more on elimin
     	ating the cause of this, and on the back of implementing core values acr
     	oss the team, look for a much more aligned, supportive and engaged team.

  ==>	Lots of good examples to follow.

  ==>	Feeling the pressure of LE, especially since I'm still fairly uncertain 
     	of the overall gameplan. Managed to clear my backlog of other things so 
     	I'm able to focus on it.

  ==>	Feel as though I have not learnt all aspects of my role

  ==>	With (almost) complete designs and clear requirements, working on a proj
     	ect with clear value for users, I can honestly say the past month has be
     	en one of the most enjoyable months I've spent at Vision6 since I starte
     	d. Can't say it's always a bed of roses, but working with a team who are
     	 passionate, focused and striving to produce a great result has been ver
     	y satisfying.

  ==>	I feel very comfortable in the company and in my position. I'm super exi
     	ted of new projects and challenges in Vision6.

  ==>	Feel as though I am gaining more confidence within my abiity to perform 
     	the role successfully. Feel comfortable within the team and my dealings 
     	with co-workers.

  ==>	I'm happiest when I feel that I'm contributing value to the team. I do f
     	eel this is generally happening (even though it's only been 1 month) and
     	 I also think my contributions will only improve in time. Hence the 8.

     	
It's not a 10 because I generally like structure in my day which is so
     	mething that I'm still working towards. I'm confident this will come tho
     	ugh in time as I do feel empowered in my role. So in a way, if I don't a
     	chieve this, it's on me :)

  ==>	- There has been a general dip in company morale recently and I think th
     	is has affected myself as well.

  ==>	Very happy with my current role, and the projects I'm involved in.

  ==>	Get projects to do. Get smart people to challenge

  ==>	LE almost done (only big project atm).
I'm on top of all my other work.

  ==>	Interesting work and great team.

  ==>	Completed on of the objectives for this quarter

  ==>	Enjoying my new role and the potential I can see with it.

  ==>	Mostly workload related, but also due to sysadmin situation.

  ==>	I multiplied all the numbers together and chose the closest number on th
     	e scale.

  ==>	When I'm working on a project, or have general BB tickets to do, I am ha
     	ppy. When things quiet down a bit, I get a little bored.

  ==>	Am currently having a lot of trouble with mental health and work-life ba
     	lance.

  ==>	Things are going well.

I feel very comfortable in my environment and 
     	enjoy the work I'm doing.

With Bart's help, I now have some goals tha
     	t I'm working towards. So at the moment, I'm very clear on what I'm tryi
     	ng to do, how I'm going to do it and why.

  ==>	It has been encouraging to have some career progression which was also r
     	ecognised in remuneration.
I believe this is a very good development in
     	 Vision6 as it will provide people with an incentive to excel in their r
     	oles.
If it continues / there is room allowed for this kind of growth, 
     	I think the team will strengthen.

  ==>	Had a slightly off month in November. A few culture issues that I have a
     	lready addressed with my TL. Hopefully December will be better.

  ==>	Have really smart and experienced environment. 
Professional guide and 
     	supervise.
Can point out my weakness and set as goal based on that.

  ==>	Contact Import gave great insights on how things work from the import pe
     	rspective. Better understanding of the framework we use and tackle issue
     	s individually spotted during test phase.

  ==>	stress

  ==>	Pretty happy with everything. Would love to be able to steer change more
     	, but understand that there are processes in place for a reason.

  ==>	I feel comfortable in my role, in last month we started a few small proj
     	ects we are going to close some projects soon. 

The vision of the com
     	pany for the next year is clarifying and based on that I can think about
     	 some new features/improvements.

  ==>	Feel refreshed after a great holiday, looking forward to new challenges.

  ==>	- Loss of Rachel as team member.  Huge loss in my opinion.  The American
     	 side of the product has been largely ignored, hence her not feeling val
     	ued or needed.
- It feels like one step forward two steps back in this 
     	team at times.

  ==>	Finding the down time frastrating at times, along with the long travel t
     	ime. 
Feel once I can do end of month reporting and possibily other tas
     	ks this rating will increase again.

  ==>	Contact Import project is finished an managed to fix JIRA jobs which wer
     	e not re-opened.
Provided some feedback to Google Contact Import sprint
     	, which was finished early as it re-used some of the CI process.
Pair p
     	rogramming started had one class, it was good.
Meanwhile have been doin
     	g some polish tasks for Contact Import.
Melissa shares sending a few go
     	od read articles for testing.

  ==>	So/so. Finding it difficult to set aside time to plan ahead due to being
     	 so time poor.

  ==>	Happy with everything but the way the Vic market died with cold weather 
     	over Christmas. Hopefully this weekend will get things moving again.

  ==>	The role continues to grow and challenge me, however this is balanced wi
     	th the team's support and guidance.

  ==>	I feel like a valued member of my team and am tracking well towards achi
     	eving my goals.

  ==>	The support and mentoring is there and you are given the freedom and spa
     	ce to perform at your best.

  ==>	its summer the days are passing by quickly and i get to interact with th
     	e techs more onsite

  ==>	I enjoy my work here at Fujitsu

  ==>	WiFi issues

  ==>	I enjoy working at Fujitsu

  ==>	A lot of items completed

  ==>	I love the work I get to do here, the team here is very helpful which ma
     	kes it not only easier to learn new things but makes you look forward to
     	 learning them. The range of tasks I get to do keep me busy which I love
     	.

  ==>	As this is a new role for me I am enjoying the new challenges, my new te
     	am and building the relationships with my customers.  Having come out of

     	me, much better for work life balance!

     	ctives. Was extremley motivated when visiting TCS and can see the benefi
     	ts in focusing heavily on patnerships to enhance our product offering. T
     	hough it is the age old thing where time is taken up on other items due 
     	to the dynamics of the Product Department and multiple competing demands
     	 that are ever present. I feel like I am always letting someone in the t
     	eam down as I cant get everything done that is required.

     	 our efforts at cultural reform are really accelerating rapidly.

     	ards it warrants a higher salary.

     	h other.

     	 some confusion or lack of communication about changing of lunch break h
     	ours from 30 min-1 hr which caused a little stress and confusion, i woul
     	d have liked more notice or been told why i had to change to a longer br
     	eak prior to submitting my timesheet to be told then but it has since al
     	l been sorted.

  ==>	It has been a challenging month due to the stock shortage but I learnt a
     	lot and it was a good test of the team's (and my own) resilience and fle
     	xibility

     	x.

     	estive season

     	 up a key amount of time. It certainly has been a interesting time to ke
     	ep the motivation of the team up at this time.

  ==>	Enjoyed involvement and progress made in senior meeting in December.  St
     	ock still an issue weighing on workload and the team which is pulling do

  ==>	I enjoy my role at look forward to many more opportunities in the future
     	.

  ==>	Much better now with Webconnect performally admirably.  Scheduling are t
     	aking into account the time required and importance of adequate time to 
     	complete the training reports agains the KPI's.  Currently the Queesnaln
     	d buisness unit has a large number of hot fire training sessions.  We ha
     	ve a piece of equipment which would be great to have back in service to 
     	use for this service delivery.

  ==>	I am regularly frustrated that I do not receive adequate tools to comple
     	te design jobs properly. Floorplates are often either not included for u
     	se or are unsatisfactory for use. As I understand the process, sales sta
     	ff are supposed to obtain floorplans to use as floorplates and ensure th
     	ose floorplans are adequate for use by consultants. This is often not th
     	e case and consultants are regularly sending floorplates to the design t
     	eam to have them cleaned up for use.

  ==>	n/a

  ==>	Feeling very overwhelmed at the moment. I understand that it's a short t
     	erm measure whilst we are recruiting and training. There's just not enou
     	gh hours in the day to get through what i need to do.

  ==>	As we have had many new staff changes in the last 6 months i'm finding t
     	hat people are not being properly trained and that's causing a knock on 
     	effect. To further this we have complacent staff and I feel like i have 
     	been doing my workload and those of other peoples/departments. I feel th
     	at if I don't then nothing would get done.

  ==>	Always busy and not a dull moment

  ==>	The SA buisness is running smothly apart from being a consultant down th
     	at has had a negative impact on the buisness by sometimes reports etc no
     	t being loaded as per KPIs

  ==>	Looking forward to improvements proposed to scheduling.

  ==>	Feel confident in my ability in this role

  ==>	Satisfied

  ==>	My motivation for out put is based solely on my loyalty to my direct man
     	ager, and on my own personal pride. I am concerned about many aspects wi
     	thin the company

  ==>	Dezling with akeeps the job interesting variety of different workplaces 
     	and people

  ==>	I enjoy my work and the challenges that we face on a day to day basis.

  ==>	Juggling multiple roles with various changes in the business.

  ==>	Enjoying recent challenges in stepping into Actring role.

  ==>	I wasn't initially going to fill this form out, but as I am being asked 
     	to provide honest feedback...   Unfortunately, my satisfaction level in 
     	my role has decreased over recent months due to a decline in my personal
     	 working conditions. When I originally accepted this role back in Januar
     	y 2015, there were a few key elements that were important to me - now th
     	ey have changed. 1) Salary: I was originally told that the offered salar
     	y was a starting salary and that I would be able to negotiate a raise af
     	ter a year of tenure. After a year of working hard (involving a high num
     	ber of unpaid overtime hours) - this never happened. Instead, I was told
     	 what was I was getting 9 months later. I appreciate the raise I did rec
     	eive, just not the change in conditions.     2. Workstation - Creative w
     	riting, research, tender response writing and proof-reading (large parts
     	 of my role) are best performed in a reasonably quiet environment. I hav
     	e learned this from years of experience and when I started in the role I
     	 was careful to find out where I would be seated in the office, which at
     	 the original address on St Kilda Rd was in an office, shared with one o
     	ther person. This meant that when under pressure to meet a deadline, I w
     	as able to shut the office door to curb the level of noise and unnecessa
     	ry distractions. However, since the move to Richmond, I have been taken 
     	out of my office and placed in a cubicle in the middle of an open-plan f
     	loor, sitting behind 5 people in telco based roles (which includes a lot
     	 of yelling back and forth) and a radio which plays all day. I therefore
     	 have to wear ear-phones most of the day in order to properly concentrat
     	e. Note: I am the only manager that was moved out of an office due the m
     	ove.  3. No parking: When I accepted the role, I was informed that there
     	 was no parking available at the St Kilda Rd office, but that the lease 
     	was coming to an end and that we would be moving to a new address where 
     	parking would be made a priority. We have now moved to Richmond, where I
     	 am the only manager (again) who is not allowed to park at the building.
     	 I have temporarily used the empty BDM parking space, but as of Nov 29th
     	 I will be expected to park on the street and move my car every 2 hours.
     	 (The 4 hour parking in the area is very limited and unreliable.) This w
     	ill cut into my daily productivity time. Again, I am the only manager in
     	 this position, which makes me question my perceived value to the compan
     	y.  4. Due to the move, on some days it can now take up to 2 hours to ge
     	t to work.  Spending at least 3 hours driving to and from work every day
     	 and then not being allowed to park at the building is simply demoraleis
     	ing. Especially considering that I spend more hours in the office that a
     	nyone else in the state.  Since I have started working at F5M, I have de
     	monstrated hard-work and loyalty to the company, but now find I myself q
     	uestioning whether the company actually values my commitment. I don't kn
     	ow of any other manager in the company who would be accepting and satisf
     	ied with these change in conditions. So why have my working conditions b
     	een disregarded?

  ==>	Very limiting & repetitive work, minimal communication & no possibility 
     	for career progression

  ==>	All though I am aware of my role, it seems that others are not, or under
     	stand.

  ==>	computer hardware has issues

  ==>	Frustrating relying on others that don't share the same urgency to clien
     	ts needs.

  ==>	I'm very satisfied with my job.

  ==>	I continue to love my job and work beside my colleauges in a job I am pa
     	ssionate about. However, I continue to become increasingly frustrated by
     	 the company itsself.

  ==>	I enjoy my role, especially the training side of my role.

  ==>	Enjoying the workplace and the work

  ==>	Need more challenges

  ==>	I am quite satisfied in my role as a Senior Safety and Training Consulta
     	nt

  ==>	I gain great satisfaction from all facets of my role.

  ==>	I am not be utilised to my capacity. Audits and development especially.

  ==>	Workplace continually improving, upcoming projects exciting.

  ==>	I still continue to enjoy my role within the company and strive to impro
     	ve things for my team, the challenges that we receive on a daily basis s
     	ometimes causes unnecessary stress when the communication levels fail to
     	 meet the ASPIRE values.  Every link in the chain needs to work cohesive
     	ly to ensure that we meet and exceed our client’s expectations and I fee
     	l that this is not happening and the continual chasing for information f
     	rom sales can creates issues.  The scheduling team is now coming togethe
     	r nicely and we are achieving a higher confirmation rate which are allow
     	ing us to now get our schedules out to the team faster. As a Team Manage
     	r it would be of benefit if we could plan for next year professional dev
     	elopment to a higher level for the consultants as we need to better trai
     	n the teams in their roles as consultants.  One on one training certainl
     	y has benefits but to be able to ensure that the team are together so as
     	 ensure one message is given.

  ==>	I would like to say 10 becuase I really do enjoy my job, but the drawbac
     	k is the slow progress of continuous improvement and the desire of some 
     	of the other RM's to want to make imprtant changes for the better of the
     	 business.  Some simple things seem a bit too hard.  But we are moving i
     	n the right direction - I probably need to be a bit more patient.

  ==>	I would like to learn more

  ==>	To Many changes to schedules, with no or short notice which makes it dif
     	ficult to appear prepared and professional.

  ==>	I feel very satisfied with my role at First 5 Minutes. I especially enjo
     	y the varied nature of my role, the autonomy I am given in completing ta
     	sks and the professionalism within the team.

  ==>	I enjoy all aspects of my work

  ==>	I feel that I makea valuable contributions to the tune

  ==>	I'm looking forward to being able to deliver some new presentations.  A 
     	fresh look to present to our clients.

  ==>	The role is rarely recognised for their hard work but quick to blame whe
     	n there is an error.

  ==>	My satisfaction in my role is only curbed by the frustration in the cons
     	tant changes to procedures & lack of training for all departments involv
     	ed in those changes.

  ==>	I am very satisfied in the role.

  ==>	Business processes / management of staff should be improved to allow wor
     	k to be billed rather than constantly accrued

  ==>	Times often get challenging when your results slip

  ==>	I think there are still some room for improvements in the role.

  ==>	Enjoying the role

  ==>	Satified with the role the excessive hours to complete necessary work is
     	 tiring at times

  ==>	I enjoy my role. I would however like to work together to develop an upd
     	ated position description that will best suit the needs of the business 
     	following the change to it after the decentralisation of the CSC functio
     	n.

  ==>	Enjoying a new challenge , can be stressful at times.

  ==>	overall very happy with my current roll

  ==>	understaffed, equipment not working the way it should, I feel overworked
     	 and underpaid, have to put in extra hours to try and keep up, still not
     	 good enough

  ==>	I feel I'm not being recognised for a lot of the work I do.  I don't thi
     	nk my title actually reflects  with what work I actually take on.  Perso
     	nally I don't understand what  separates me from being a supervisor and 
     	a manager.

  ==>	The I.T. Is quite frustrating at times

  ==>	Great so far.

  ==>	I feel frustrated when members of the Leadership team tolerate unaccepta
     	ble behaviour/poor performance from team members.  Whilst my satisfactio
     	n in my role is high, it would move upwards from 8 if everyone embraced 
     	a sense of urgency.

  ==>	New role that gives me the opportunity to improve the value of my contri
     	bution to our business

  ==>	Spread over to many roles. Prof Dev not allocated outside F5M

  ==>	First week was hectic as expected, computer issues caused frustration.

  ==>	overall very happy with my current role

  ==>	The hours are getting out of hand.  Although we may only have 4 hours of
     	 training, the travel is more often than not taking up the rest of the d
     	ay.  Admin work can only be completed at home after hours.  Working till
     	 7.30 - 8pm is not uncommon.  Having to use weekends to complete jobs an
     	d prep for the following week is also common.

  ==>	More than enough to fill the days and some good results coming through

  ==>	Nil

  ==>	I enjoy the role it is dynamic

  ==>	My work is satisfying as I can measure personal contribution/s and outco
     	mes, however when other team members do not perform to known required st
     	andards I feel greatly let down.

  ==>	Delays and frustation caused by failures in hardware. Also, missing info
     	rmation when conducting establishments.

  ==>	I enjoy my role and the people I work with.

  ==>	Just plodding along

  ==>	I find it takes too long to get simple things happening and the need to 
     	rely on others with differing sets of priorities

  ==>	I feel frustrated that scheduling may not have considered that, after co
     	nducting events all day on the last day of the week then having to trave
     	l back to Brisbane, that I will not be allocated time to complete my rep
     	orts in the following week.

  ==>	I love my job

  ==>	Although busy I am happy with the role

  ==>	I am enjoying the challenges being created to assist in meeting expectat
     	ions of delivery.

  ==>	I could still do with more training.

  ==>	I am satisfied with my role and I am enjoying my tasks, very much, howev
     	er I have been with F5M just over 2 years, and it never mentioned any in
     	crease in my current pay.

  ==>	I am satisified in my role however i see that I need some assistance wit
     	h in the team. I am currently feeling that I can not focus all my attent
     	ion to a task and I believe I have missed critical items.

  ==>	Frustration is a part of our every day tasks . Inadequate technology cha
     	llenges our time management on a daily basis.

  ==>	Design still getting blamed for situations out of our control. And other
     	s not following processes to assist desing in doing job correctly.  This
     	 puts more pressure on design to get work done.

  ==>	I'm quite satisfied, I just wish we had more time allocated to finish jo
     	bs off. We often have to work past 1700 particularly on reginal trips

  ==>	I am very happy in my role.

  ==>	Much happier than I used to be.

  ==>	Greater communication between Sales and Scheduling would be appreciated.

  ==>	During busy periods, insufficient time is allocated to the administrativ
     	e function associated with on site tasks. Greg Peever is attempting to a
     	ddress this issue. There are ongoing issues with insufficient or incorre
     	ct information being provided on consultants schedules. Again, I believe
     	 Greg is trying hard to rectify these issues.

  ==>	I am satisfied in this role

  ==>	I believe my role is growing with many smaller projects that are distrac
     	ting me from succeeding on bigger operational initiatives that could imp
     	rove the business.

  ==>	I would like to be involve more in Learning and Development packages to 
     	bring F5M to as the premier provider of High Level Security and Counter-
     	Terrorism training (Codes Black and Purple). Maybe a new title clarifica
     	tion as a marketing tool for clients.

  ==>	Satisfied

  ==>	At the moment my role is somewhat different but in essence I am learning
     	 a great deal about how 'The back end works' (CMARS, Web Connect etc)

  ==>	Nothing new to report

  ==>	Enjoy the role and improvements in Key Accounts. Back end procedures and
     	 workflow can be improved to free me up.

  ==>	I am very satisfied in my role and enjoy meeting people

  ==>	A Great office and atmosphere

  ==>	Some of the IT issues are giving me some dissatisfaction

  ==>	I'm pretty satisfied with my job, sometimes frustrating when there's not
     	 not much time allocated to get your attendance registers ready for the 
     	next week, but that's just apart of the job I guess... learning to adapt
     	.

  ==>	I would like to spend more time on the business rather than in the busin
     	ess. I plan to work on strategies to resolve this.

  ==>	Finding time frames very tight when it comes to audits/establishments wh
     	ich are out of the normal

  ==>	To many things on the plate. My specialist skills not being used to adva
     	nce the company

  ==>	Very satisfying role together with a team that keeps me on my toes!

  ==>	I enjoy my role as Operations Manager - however I feel that I am been pu
     	lled in too directions. I have a large amount of direct reports and I fe
     	el sometimes I am not spending enough time with the employees to assist 
     	with their development.

  ==>	I still enjoy my role and love some of the challenges that I face everyd
     	ay.  I work with a good group of people who are trying to do there best.
     	  I am developing all the time and look forward to increasing my abiliti
     	es to serve our client better.  The only frustration is at time s Ifeel 
     	a bit overloaded and can not complete the task that are either set by me
     	 or set by others.

  ==>	I am very happy in my role, it gives me freedom of being in control of m
     	y movements to an extent and doesn't hold me down in an office environme
     	nt.

  ==>	I am still completing reports and design work at 9 o'clock at night afte
     	r being at most sights to keep up with reports and design work at 6am

  ==>	Near continuous system issues with the CMARS over the last month or so h
     	ave made things unnessesarily difficult.

  ==>	I am finding work intellectually challenging and invigorating.  Further,
     	 I love the new premises.

  ==>	I am satisfied in this role

  ==>	I feel that my role is impacted not only by myself, but from all of our 
     	team, both locally in NSW and across the country. I feel like my direct 
     	supervisor is responsible for too much within our office and should have
     	 some managerial support. In essence I feel like he is a talented person
     	 in our field, however is wasted by being responsible for  low level res
     	ponsibilities that take up too much time. I also am not a fan of some of
     	 the new training material we have been provided. I feel that it shows t
     	hat there is a disconnect with what we are as a company and what our cli
     	ents needs are.

  ==>	certain IT issues and systems have taken away some job satisfaction for 
     	me.

  ==>	Generally happy with my role.Once the new procedures and equipment are i
     	mplemented i believe this will improve on the general attitude from all 
     	consultants.

  ==>	So happy to be here

  ==>	Frustrations with targets and lack of financial transparency is sometime
     	s frustrating

  ==>	Happy In my position

  ==>	There have been some extremely difficult times over the past few months 
     	with beddiung down a new team and also dealing with Property Managers an
     	d clients' expectations.  I have had very little personal down time whic
     	h has not helped.

  ==>	Enjoying the role

  ==>	very good

  ==>	Overall am satisfied within role however I am frustrated at times with s
     	cheduling and work allocation among the consultants.

  ==>	Enjoying the challenge of additional responsibility

  ==>	The establishments process is a bit too complex. Also, receiving planner
     	s too late on Fridays does not allow enough time to prepare for sessions
     	.

  ==>	Pretty happy

  ==>	I am quite satisfied in my current role.

  ==>	I am very satisfied in my role and enjoy meeting people

  ==>	Taking on more responsibility but not being acknowledge for it.

  ==>	I prefer doing the jobs in the north/ north east/ east region, where I l
     	ive.  The majority of my sessions are in the East/ south east so I curre
     	ntly spend alot of time sitting in traffic which is very frustrating.

  ==>	To many changes - Establishments/Powerpoints without any consultation.

  ==>	I am enjoying my role

  ==>	Your not using my expertese

  ==>	Happy with my role

  ==>	NA

  ==>	There has been some issues with sheduling times especially getting from 
     	job to job in the city where time has not been allowed for walking betwe
     	en carpark and job. But I believe this is to be sorted out next week.

  ==>	I realise that an alternative system is soon to be released however, cur
     	rently completing reports up to 8:30pm at night.

  ==>	Satisfied

  ==>	I am still enjoying my role even though at the moment its a bit fracture
     	d, as wwe are trying to manage not only the team but othert client issue
     	.  The challenges of looking after BCC is very satisfying and I believe 
     	we are achieving great results.

  ==>	All going well, and continuing to grow the Key Accounts

  ==>	I enjoy my work, but am currently covering for sick personell so am find
     	ing it difficult to focus on my new role as Operations Manager.

  ==>	The role is providing significant challenges and diversity which is good
     	.

  ==>	Only week one so too early to tell.

  ==>	I am satisfied in this role

  ==>	I enjoy my role as a Consultant. Meeting clients, advising clients, trai
     	ning clients is what I love doing.

  ==>	I haven't recieved any new equipment yet including flip charts for the n
     	ew presentation.

  ==>	Going well so far - there are certainly challenges that the system prese
     	nts that limit maximisation of revenue.

  ==>	Continuing to get a great mix of support and responsibility.

  ==>	Continue to enjoy the role

  ==>	Generally happy in the role, but would like more project works.

  ==>	Impact on workload of Sky5 acquistion as a result of unsuccesful integra
     	tion works

  ==>	Struggling to find the time to fulfil my role. we are currently looking 
     	to engag another trainer and this should ease,

  ==>	To many changes for a number of different clients ie. Regis etc . Notes 
     	need to be available to ensure all consultants are providing the correct
     	 sessions etc for example what to present in Year 1 - 2 - 3 etc.

  ==>	Happy to be taking on more responsibility with the Design Department

  ==>	I feel like my role contributes to the business success which gives me s
     	atisfaction.

  ==>	I find my role enjoyable , rewarding and challenging.

  ==>	Not enough hours in the day

  ==>	I understand the schedule is hard to plan for, I have found that we are 
     	not nessacarily been scheduled to work in a logical area eg close to hom
     	e areas when others who do not live local are. This would save in time a
     	nd create more productivity if we did. I undestand this cant always happ
     	en, but it does occur every week. This would be my only feedback.

  ==>	Whilst Im enjoying growing the business, the more I win, the more work. 
     	The administration is heavy and everything from PO's, Invoicing, Schedul
     	ing, Complaints, Proposals, New business all hits our team.

  ==>	I feel that sometimes I am chasing my tail, and it gets a bit overwhelmi
     	ng.

     	em are really challenging and can cause me to become aggitated.

  ==>	Am very happy here and enjoy working here.

  ==>	I am not as happy with the new paperwork and way of doing things as I us
     	ed to be with the old system. I know it's a matter of getting used to it
     	 but in my opinion it is not as easy to work with, and has been a cause 
     	of some confusion with times.

  ==>	generally satisfied although sometimes feel that i am left out of the lo
     	op.

  ==>	Recent scheduling has meant less time sitting in traffic reducing the ti
     	me spent after hours catching up on admin work.

  ==>	I am genneraly happy with my work, the admin taks have increased. I enjo
     	y new projects and getting hands on with assiting clients needs.

  ==>	Very happy in my role.

  ==>	Looking forward to kicking some goals this year. This year’s focus will 
     	be on ensuring projects are prioritised, attainable and delivered with s
     	uccess.

  ==>	Overall enjoying my time here and the challenge of working within First 
     	5 Minutes

  ==>	Happy, Happy, Happy!

  ==>	not nailing completing the difficult tasks

  ==>	General Feedback: One area that I need to work on with GT is a hierarchy
     	 of priorities, as there are many aspects of this role that are all impo
     	rtant to achieving the overall goal of smooth HR and system function. On
     	e approach would be to adopt Sentrian's Agile approach to workflow and h
     	ave an HR and Systems target for each month that I am accountable for. H
     	aving the intelliHR goals feature up and running will be a big help in t
     	his area for both myself and the broader team.

  ==>	I enjoy the people that I work with and am appreciative of the feedback 
     	I am given in my work. I find it extremely compliance heavy and very muc
     	h at a "processing/back offis" level.  I don't feel that there is value 
     	seen in the time spent doing 'goal' work or looking into inefficiencies 
     	through the use of other programs. As an example, ML has requested that 
     	I trial the MYOB workpapers however said that I'm to do so when I'm a bi
     	t quieter, however I'm "flat out until Xmas". Surely if there is the bel
     	ief it will make our business more efficient, the sooner the better, oth
     	erwise it is going to be the next financial year before we see any pay-o
     	ff from what we already have.

  ==>	"Happiness" is always hard to define when it comes to work, as there are
     	 many facets of work that need to align for it to be a 10/10. If I was t
     	o answer this according to the Simon Sinek philosophy, I would say: WHAT
     	 – Am I happy in what I am doing? Absolutely! I really enjoy the freedom
     	 I am afforded and the diversity of the role. The q4 team is very easy t
     	o get along with and the relaxed and harmonious work environment is some
     	thing the Directors should be proud of. WHY – Am I happy with why I am d
     	oing what I am doing? Hard to say… This can only be answered when you ‘f
     	eel’ like you align with the firm’s identity, and this then creates unit
     	y amongst the broader team. I struggle to consistently align myself with
     	 the firm’s values, only because I look at all the current branding deta
     	il (e.g. “Be Better” – ownership / personal accountability / personal br
     	and) – and I don’t see this being ‘sold through’.  It is not enough for 
     	me to come to work because it is operationally fulfilling and a great wo
     	rkplace (although I am grateful for this). I am still searching for the 
     	q4 “why”. I ‘feel’ like I am in the same position that I was in a year a
     	go at MJA; that is, not inspired by the momentum of the business to live
     	 it’s values.

  ==>	I'm still happy in my role. I'm not 100% on everything but I am getting 
     	there.

  ==>	Feeling comfortable overall with changes being made, and feel like I can
     	 already see small impacts

  ==>	There have been days I struggle with understanding my work, other days I
     	 feel like I am really contributing.

  ==>	progress is being made to change my role

  ==>	I love the versatility of my role and am very much looking forward to wo
     	rking with our newly assigned marketing team. I am disappointed to 'feel
     	' I have not added $ value this quarter.

  ==>	q4 financial is a wonderful place to work and I know that my time here i
     	s not as long as long as I had hoped but I hope to continue to learn and
     	 grow as much as I can. As I have said before I owe much of my success t
     	o the team here at q4 but especially my manager Megan who has gone above
     	 and beyond to make me the person I am today. I am excited that FP team 
     	would like me to support them remotely whilst I settle in to Sydney and 
     	help induct our new team member.

  ==>	Happy overall, and with the completion of my ADFP, I am feeling prepared
     	 for the next level of my role.

  ==>	Always nice to start a new financial year, clean and clear slate, howeve
     	r, lots of administration was distracting from 1 July due to poor planni
     	ng prior.  CM's still struggling to look outside the box.  Not yet confi
     	dent we can hit our monthly revenue targets but very motivated to assist
     	 as and when required.

  ==>	It's nice to complete work and be given guidance and assistance where ne
     	eded with review points to learn from

  ==>	I am very happy here and feel blessed to have this oppertunity

  ==>	Still feel like I am doing a lot of admin stuff while Nadine finds her f
     	eet.  It  is probably just be that time of year as well.  Have also had 
     	a bit more of an organisation role in terms of CMs given AR has been out
     	 of the office

  ==>	Quite happy to be doing what I am doing.

  ==>	Happy with the progress we have had in terms of work in the last couple 
     	of weeks

  ==>	I am very grateful for this opportunity

  ==>	I feel under utilised & frustrated in my current role

  ==>	Class Transition has been tedious and taken up more time than anticipate
     	d but otherwise happy

  ==>	Team cohesion is off track

  ==>	I feel under utilised & frustrated in my current role

  ==>	Learning to better juggle to two areas of the role.

  ==>	Still feel pulled in lots of directions.

  ==>	Happy, amount of admin stuff reducing and getting some traction with job
     	s etc

  ==>	progress changes daily

  ==>	Very happy with the last month, given the start of my new role and the r
     	eview cycle. Enjoying the learning that it brings along

  ==>	Happy to get things out the door but I just don't want to miss anything 
     	in the rush to get things finished.

  ==>	The pressure is on to get work completed before xmas (which i have no pr
     	oblem with) but we are down on production staff (compared to last year),
     	 a couple of months ago i was asked if doing processing work was the bes
     	t use of my time, now gone full circle the other way. With the looming d
     	eparture (albeit not permanent) of two client managers, i am concerned w
     	ith what is going to happen within the Accountancy team.

  ==>	I have been a little frusrated and stressed this month . I have been str
     	uggling with our workload and tasks

  ==>	Happy to be working on a more holistic approach to client advice

  ==>	This reflects big last 12-18 months and the sense of fatigue discussed p
     	reviously.  Also the last month of not being in a position to have the t
     	ime to do more of the items I need and want to be

  ==>	lots of momentum pre xmas to get jobs out, all other work under control 
     	and on track to get done pre leave

  ==>	I believe I am achieving workflow outcomes within the Bookkeeping team o
     	f q4 financial.

  ==>	Disappointing end to the year with Hayley departing, it would have been 
     	good to turn this around considering the 6 month investment. It was evid
     	ent that we did not manage expectations well, although this is always a 
     	challenge in small businesses where role changes or sideways progression
     	 is typically not available as a solution.

  ==>	loving it!

  ==>	Q4 continues to be a bumpy ride but a christmas break and getting some p
     	ersonal assistance  means i am feeling a bit more on top of things. Ther
     	e is a significant amount of work to get done in the next six months but
     	 I know plans are being put into action to help achieve this.

  ==>	I am happy within my role but I have realised that I don't want to be a 
     	CSO for another 1-2 years. I would like to be able to help the team more
     	 by learning the role of a paraplanner (not now of course but that is th
     	e next role I would like to take on). I believe it will be a big help to
     	 the team.

  ==>	I feel like I am getting more hang of my new responsibilities as an AA a
     	nd happy to be able to apply my learning on to my job.

  ==>	I am glad that my team have trusted in to step up, complete new job role
     	s and have confidence in me to do my job.

  ==>	Things are busy at the moment, the integration of FP waiting on the Acco
     	unting team is adding pressure to turn around times for FP

  ==>	I am finding the role rewarding and challenging.  The computer systems c
     	an be a bit of challenge, especially when I am trying to keep a healthy 
     	time sheet.

  ==>	Feels like we have built a very functional team, as there is a great tea
     	m dynamic at the moment. Having Alethea back on board has been very posi
     	tive, as she provides ongoing direction and sets clear priorities.

  ==>	lots of momentum pre xmas to get jobs out, all other work under control 
     	and on track to get done pre leave

     	e next role I would like to take on). I believe it will be a big help to
     	 the team.

  ==>	Lots on and gets a bit mechanical sometimes, especially with ROAs. But I
     	 am excited about the new client work and super reforms work that contin
     	ue to help me learn.

  ==>	I continue to enjoy the role, as assisting the team daily with issues th
     	at impact their productivity, is both interesting and rewarding. I would
     	 rate my happiness higher if I felt that there was more connection with 
     	my role and the Directors priorities. I am working on the q4 plans which
     	 I believe will help align me and the team to the firm's 1-page plan. Th
     	ere still appears to be limited focus or clarity on the firm's strategy,
     	 and the steps that re required to achieve the firm's goals. I.e. our st
     	rategy meetings remain operationally focused.

  ==>	I am enjoying the work and the working environment.

  ==>	Happy with the current role, but I feel a bit stressed at times with the
     	 amount of work that is on.

  ==>	Things are still clunky, I don't have time to complete tasks timely and 
     	continue to be a bottle neck for the team and outcomes

  ==>	Happy, I seem to be getting through what I need to before I go without t
     	oo many major issues

  ==>	I believe there is a good feeling in the office.  One of optimism and th
     	e feeling that we are starting to get some momentum.  We need to continu
     	ally stop to celebrate our successes and reward where appropriate.  It i
     	s the little things that count!!

  ==>	Concerned about workflow

  ==>	Love my new position, love working with Kelly

  ==>	I'm really enjoying it

  ==>	Work is still busy in Accounting but we are getting back on top of Compl
     	iance.

  ==>	I am happy in my role as I have been given new opportunities to step up 
     	and be involved in the SOA and ROA process

  ==>	Loving the role and the team

  ==>	Love the variety of work and exposure to new things - Estate Planning, S
     	uper reform

  ==>	The accounting team has worked well together to get compliance completed
     	 as much as we can, had good support with each other. I have been spendi
     	ng more time training (on the job/client issues) and assisting Lucia and
     	 Maddie but hopefully their level of work will continue to improve.

  ==>	Feeling a little bit of fatigue with being pulled in a million different
     	 directions every day.  Now conscious that time is ticking away and ther
     	e are things that simply will not get done this side of June 30.  A cert
     	ain level of frustration as I wanted to have a lot of things ticked off 
     	internally come 30 June.

  ==>	So far so good!

  ==>	feeling good overall, happy about the opportunity to conduct new client 
     	meeting and participation in other client meetings. I see myself connect
     	ing the picture better for a lot more clients now.

  ==>	Took a bit to get back in the swing of things but I think I have caught 
     	up now

  ==>	More staff changes but they havent greatly impacted (see comments below)
     	, higher stress with Grant being away and just bad timing with Orbit Cap
     	ital and the Audit issues/dealing with ASIC.

  ==>	Not required as completed with Nov 2017 form.

  ==>	Just lacking a bit of momentum at the moment, lots of jobs half finished
     	.  Hopefully can get it cleared this side of Xmas for a clean start in N
     	ew Year.

  ==>	Love my job, love the team, very happy!

  ==>	Overall I feel comfortable in my role and happy to ask for assistance.

  ==>	I'm no more or less content/happy than last time I don't feel.  There ar
     	e a significant number of challenges still to go, I feel at time I seem 
     	to be doing lots of work and hours and not necessarily making large in r
     	oads, so the break over Xmas will be good to reset

  ==>	Loving the firm and the people I work with, however am not feeling compl
     	etely satisfied in my current role.

  ==>	Currently a good mix of compliance and generating new business

  ==>	Starting to feel more confident in my role and more efficient. Great tea
     	m environment.

  ==>	Happy in my role and feel supported

  ==>	Currently low on work and feeling as though the focus of my role has bec
     	ome more compliance focused.
